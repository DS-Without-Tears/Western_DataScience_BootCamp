In this Unit, the general idea of data science and machine learning are introduced by explaining how they are necessary tools in our research. Python as a programming tool is introduced as well. The purpose of this boot camp is not to teach coding, however, we still write codes to clean data and build models. All the codes will be explained carefully to make sure that the reader can follow the logic. We will cover the following: 

Lesson0: A general idea and introduction about the course and instructors with some logistics related to getting the certificate.

Lesson1: Some real-world examples of how data science can be a useful tool for research/ work.

Lesson 2: Where data come from, and how (where) they can be stored.

Lesson 3: A brief introduction to some of the popular machine learning algorithms.

Code 0: A very basic introduction to Python. 

Ethics: An introduction to the important topic of ethics in artificial intelligence.
