In this Unit:

we are focusing on data. One major part of data science is related to dealing with real-world data. Data pre-processing, cleaning and visualization play vital roles in developing useful machine learning algorithms. We will cover the following:

- Lesson 1: We explore the basics of data cleaning.
- Lesson 2: To load csv files python provides us with a useful library which we explore in this lesson. Link to the Google Colab: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/11TCuCyf3m4LJeBun1Fvis_l29vOe7gLx?authuser=1
- Lesson 3: Data visualization plays an important role in our understanding of data. Matplotlib is a library in Python which helps us to make meaningful plots and graphs. A short video summerizing the lesson is provided as well:
