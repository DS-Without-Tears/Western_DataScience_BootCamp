# Ciao, friends!
In the last few weeks we were really excited about having you all in this BootCamp! We are hoping that we were able to introduce you to the big world of data science! 
In this chapter, we are not going to put any new material! In this lesson, we are summarizing what we have learned in this BootCamp! And, we are going to suggest a list of further readings in the next lesson!
